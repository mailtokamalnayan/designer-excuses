# Designer Excuses
Designer Excuses is a list of handy excuses that designers give (or can give). The application is based on Jon Moore's [Medium post](https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/100-excuses-for-designers-517344cdd910#.l6jl2kiw8) of 100 Excuses for Designers.

## Contributing
You can contribute by adding a new excuse or by making the code better. The app is Gulp powered. You can add your excuse in the `data.json` file. Looking forward to your PRs.

## Install

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to setup Gulp dependencies
3. Run `gulp dev` to spin up a local build and development server
